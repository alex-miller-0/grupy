This folder contains an example calculation for PbTe with the following:

- the grupy.in file
- input and output for the Quantum Espresso calculations (1.00=equilibrium volume, 0.99=smaller volume, 1.01=larger volume)
- q2r.in and matdyn.in for each calculation as generated by grupy
- dynamical matrix files generated by Quantum Espresso using these scripts
- PbTe.grupy.out and PbTe.grupy.bands.out files

Note: these results are not necessarily scientifically valid; they are simply meant to provide an example.
